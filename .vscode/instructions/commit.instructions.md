# Commit Message Guidelines

Please use Conventional Commit messages when committing changes to the project. Follow these guidelines:

- **Structure**:  
  Use a commit type, an optional scope, a colon, and a short description.  
  Example: `feat(login): add user authentication functionality`

- **Commit Types**:  
  Choose one from:  
  - `feat` for new features  
  - `fix` for bug fixes  
  - `docs` for documentation changes  
  - `style` for code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)  
  - `refactor` for code refactoring  
  - `perf` for performance improvements  
  - `test` for adding or modifying tests  
  - `chore` for maintenance tasks or configuration changes  

- **Subject**:  
  - Write in lower case (except for proper nouns).  
  - Keep the subject concise and descriptive.

- **Body (optional)**:  
  If needed, include additional context or details in a separate paragraph after the subject.

- **Footer (optional)**:  
  Add issue references or breaking changes notes if applicable.

Ensure each commit message clearly explains the changes introduced.
