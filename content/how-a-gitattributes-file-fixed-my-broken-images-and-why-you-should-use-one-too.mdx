Recently, I ran into an issue where images in a documentation repository wouldn't render locally. After some digging, I realized the problem was that Git wasn't treating image files as binary, causing them to break, even in VSCode. The fix? Adding a `.gitattributes` file!

This post explains why `.gitattributes` matters, what problems it solves, and how you can use it to avoid file mishandling in your own projects.

### **What is a `.gitattributes` File?**

A `.gitattributes` file is a simple text file you add to your repository to tell Git how to handle specific files or patterns. Each line specifies a pattern (like `*.png`) and one or more attributes (like marking a file as binary).

**Example:**

```
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.md text
```

### **Why is `.gitattributes` Important?**

- **Prevents Broken Images and Binaries:**  
  Without proper attributes, Git might treat images or other binaries as text, corrupting them during commits or merges.
- **Consistent Line Endings:**  
  Handles differences between Windows (CRLF) and Unix (LF) systems, avoiding annoying diffs and merge conflicts caused by inconsistent line endings.
- **Improves Diffs and Merges:**  
  You can tell Git to ignore diffs for generated files, or use custom merge strategies for complex file types.
- **Better Collaboration:**  
  Ensures everyone on your team, regardless of OS or editor, works with files in the correct format.

### **What Files Should You Add to `.gitattributes`?**

- **Images and Binaries:**  
  Mark all image, audio, video, and compiled files as `binary`:
  ```
  *.png binary
  *.jpg binary
  *.gif binary
  *.pdf binary
  *.zip binary
  ```
- **Text Files:**  
  Enforce consistent line endings:
  ```
  *.js eol=lf
  *.jsx eol=lf
  *.md text
  ```
- **Large Files:**  
  For large assets, consider using Git LFS and mark them in `.gitattributes`:
  ```
  *.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
  ```
- **Generated or Vendor Files:**  
  Hide from diffs or language stats:
  ```
  /dist/* linguist-generated=true
  ```

### **Sample `.gitattributes` for a Documentation Repo**

```gitattributes
# Treat images as binary
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.gif binary
*.svg binary # SVGs are text-based (XML) but often treated as binary to prevent line-ending/merge issues.

# Treat markdown as text
*.md text

# Enforce LF for code files
*.js eol=lf
*.jsx eol=lf
*.json eol=lf

# Hide build files from diffs and stats
/dist/* linguist-generated=true
```

### **How to Add and Commit a `.gitattributes` File**

1. Create a `.gitattributes` file in your repo's root.
2. Add the patterns and attributes you need.
3. Commit the file:
   ```
   git add .gitattributes
   git commit -m "Add .gitattributes for correct file handling"
   git push
   ```

### **Extra Tips**

- Use `.gitattributes` to set custom merge strategies or encoding for special file types.
- For existing repos, you may need to re-add files with `git add --renormalize .` to apply new attributes.
- For really big files (like Photoshop files), look into [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
