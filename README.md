## Technologies

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that enables hybrid static and server rendering, fast refresh, code splitting, built-in CSS support, and more. To learn more about Next.js, you can visit their [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) or [blog](https://nextjs.org/blog).

It also uses [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks to build your React applications with speed. Chakra UI follows WAI-ARIA standards, supports light and dark modes, and offers a rich set of components and hooks. You can explore the [components](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components) or the [guides](https://chakra-ui.com/guides) to get started with Chakra UI.

Another key technology in this project is [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), a powerful motion library for React. Framer Motion allows you to create declarative animations, complex gestures, scroll-triggered effects, and layout animations with ease. It also supports server-side rendering and has a simple yet expressive syntax. You can check out the [examples](https://www.framer.com/motion/examples/) or the [documentation](https://www.framer.com/motion/documentation/) to learn more about Framer Motion.
